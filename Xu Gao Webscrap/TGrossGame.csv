The in-app purchases are now very affordable and offer many practical items. The balance has tipped more evenly for new players to become formidable empires. The game crashes much less often however the chat service is still very glitchy.

Have been playing for over 2 years now and have never tired of it. Keeps changing and staying relevant.  Changes too fast to keep up sometimes though.  Frustrating on that part for sure.  Also, if you want to be competitive this game is not FREE!  To enjoy the game and be competitive you must spend money, and not just a little bit.  This game will run into thousands of dollars if you want to really play.  Just the truth.  I love the game and continue to spend and play.

If you don't buy the 2nd builder then when you launch the app again it tries again, and when you unlock the phone with it open it tries again, and again, and again. Even in the middle of the game it tries to sell it. It doesn't add anything to the genre it comes from, and even detracts from itself with all the sales in your face.  It also throws ""limited time offers"" at you, however if you actually watch the timer you see that when it hits 0 it sets back to its original time to try again.

Certainly worth it for a free game. What can't I say for it? Well, core game play needs a little buffing in my opinion. Constant point capturing is fun enough, but it's all you get. No real deathmatch, no CTF, just capture the points and smash the other team. Also, the graphics aren't terrible, but it's a far cry from stunning.","1,19,2017",Pixonic LLC,3,438,645,0,0.7643,0.106,0,0.221

I have done the numbers on a lot of my winnings and just 5 mins ago I had my bet at 900k, the game has 20 lines and the bet is 45000 per line and the line pays 600 x the bet per line for matching 5 so it is 600x45000 and the winnings for this is 27,000,000 million credits but they only gave me 7 million credits. This is happening on every game no matter what machine I play on, now the one thing that really is worse is that when you get the bonus they take the winning and give you 1/6th of what you are really supposed to win.

And recently picked it up again. Maybe a couple of weeks ago, I was at a 20k/40k table, or maybe it was 40k/80k. I was doing well, had about 4m from initial buy in of 800k. Then a bad run and went down to 2.5m. I was pretty sure that I had about 400k chips aside from the 800 I had used to buy in. Anyway, I lost a hand where I went all in with the 2.5m and found that the 400k I remembered left, had gone. Just happened again.wtf","12,25,2016",Zynga,1,512,620,0,0.7239,0.053,0,0.118

My primary issue is as an action title that the kinetics of the sprite collision need a bit more tweaking. There are several other titles similar to this game, with inferior graphics, that make you FEEL the clash and clang of sword play with more veracity.  Secondly, the sheer number of layers in game play are a bit daunting for a newbie. Complimentary, the smoothness, movement and voice acting are amazing.

That said hope you like the very first slot Dorothy and Toto.. your going to spend most of your time there due to the only slot with a pretty small minimum bet (for killing time of course)... not a bad slot at all but after staring at that same one for days or weeks you will see what I mean.

But I do. It seems to be a kind of road side robbery, albeit perhaps unintentionally by the developers. Rewards, indeed even free spins during games seem to come less and less by level 40 or so, winnings decrease substantially and the 60 million I just purchased (about 20.99 CAD) lasted not even twenty minutes - and I'm an exceedingly careful player. Not much play time for this kind of money.  But perhaps I'm on the lower end of income when it comes to playing this and others pour lots into here not realizing twenty dollars might get you twenty minutes of careful gameplay.  An otherwise fantastic game: If I were made of money. Likely uninstalling though.  Thanks for the efforts all the same, developers.","2,9,2017",Murka Ltd.,2,957,666,0,0.987,0.012,0,0.201

4269,Strategy,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,See-Back Ac,Castle Clash: Rise of Beasts,Top Grossing Games,"People who say this game is gambling for your money, know that they are half wrong.   I have bought a thing or two but the game gives enough Gems through gameplay that you could actually, patiently, get the Gems you require in some time. Yes, at the beginning it isn't easy to get as much gems as you may require to get the OP legends, because you don't have enough quests open nor any other extras, but this game isn't going to let you get the best legends early in a game for free now are they? Exactly, they allow you to gradually level up with Shard legends until you are able to open most quests (and few other bits) which will begin to generate you some Gems and eventually give you chances to get the OP legend.   Simple. And once you get the OP legend it wouldn't take long to boost it up quickly because you'll have a high level under Monsters Attack to boost it quickly.   Yes, sure. The game does give you loads of options that allow you to buy stuff but they aren't necessary to play the game. I bought a thing or two but only because it was ether a very good deal or because I was inpatient. Not because the game made me.","2,10,2017",IGG.COM,5,1134,667,3,0.9813,0.048,0,0.157

If you play on a low end table, there is some dork that purchased 1billion in chips to bully lower stakes player. If you have 100m to 1billion , you should only be allowed to play on higher stakes tables. It's no sweat to go all in, as you are a fake 100millionaire who purchased chips.

From tournaments to bonuses, and the rings. The issue I have with the game is, the app it's self seems to be rigged. Of course, I cannot say for sure, but the hands that are delt on a back to back basis are unrealistic. In app purchase games always have a way to make you pay to play, which in turn makes the app not free. On the other hand, the app seems to be in favor of people who constantly spend money on chips.

Honestly I'm at level 21 palace and I realize that it wasn't skill but money that got me there. The packs start out at about $20 as a discount but eventually all prices for packs are $50 to $100. The problem with this game is that they make it extremely difficult to get to a competitive level without purchasing packs or using very large amounts of rare gold in game - which ultimately leads to in game purchases. At my level there are both time boosts and resources that are so high priced and so rare to acquire that I can't level anything enough to keep a self-sustaining city.  Oh and if you are attacked by a peer with a large army you can expect to have to go to in game purchasesâ just to make up for your loss.

You can level up if you pay money but it's just a game and you wont get that money back. Its kinda fun for the few spins you do get but it goes to quick. The daily bonus is random and typically only about 150 thousand. Still goes by real quick.,"2,9,2017",Scientific Games Interactive,1,464,666,0,0.8559,0.032,0,0.116

First is being able to donate resources and gems. We should also be able to add builders onto a peoject in order to divide the time left. Also if there were a way to convert between different resources. If there were something like a resource converter. Lastly if there was a way to tell how long someone has been offline like in Clash of Lords. It makes it easier to see who is active.

Building gardens,  landscaping, etc., BUT, to do anything at all you need stars. The stars are very hard to earn after just a few levels of play,  and when you do earn them, it's only one at a time. Also when a level is completed, very few coins are earned, but many, many coins are needed to get boosts, etc. to help win the levels. It is not worth it to buy any coins. Not that much fun. Could be lots better if they weren't so stingy with stars and coins.

While the game has some in-app purchases that can facilitate acquiring better cards more quickly, it isn't to the degree that you have to pay to play. You can advance and get better based off skill and time put into the game. I sincerely hope the developers aren't trying to pull people in, then start unleashing content that you have to pay for. Unless/until that happens, 5 stars.","2,3,2017",KONAMI,5,399,660,1,0.9475,0.034,0,0.22

That and the booster packs don't change often enough. It would be nice to cycle between 10 or so packs every couple of days. That way we can have a nice variety. Everything else is fantastic though.

The gameplay is good but they need to either expand the playing most to give a side or remove some cards i.e. ones that rely on having multiple creature types i.e. machine king. The main I can't give it 5 stars is the amount of times I attempt to log in only to be told the servers are full.plan ahead or at least be flexible in your development.,"1,29,2017",KONAMI,3,448,655,6,0.9062,0.0,0,0.168

Interesting methods of matching allow the game play to continually change and present different challenges  as you play.  As with all free games, frequent ads & requests to connect to Facebook are bothersome, but there may not be quite as many of them as there used to be.

You guys did a very good job in the new update, we have to unlock troops in one barrack and then train in all. The main point is that when you unlock a troop in two or more barracks the training time gets reduced, like when I unlocked the wizard it took four minutes to train, when I unlocked it in the second barracks it's time reduced to 1 minute .  The game would be more awesome when you get more amazing troops and all. But more further you can bring new troops and all but for lower town halls.  You can even bring a troop from clash royale.  You can even reduce the time taken to train troops, and their levelling up cost can also be increased.  Then you can get more walls like 50 walls each town hall,  then there would be 500 walls  (if you deduct the walls of th 1) .  ðððððððð","2,6,2017",Supercell,5,825,663,0,0.8804,0.018,0,0.094

I loved it all the graphics were good it's addictive the gameplay was good everything was extremely good.

Given you typically have less cards in your hand, your deck, and less cards you can play on the field (3 monster cards is the limit instead of 5), everything else is the exact same. You buy packs, you construct your deck the way you want it, and you play as Yu-Gi-Oh characters which I totally love. There's even a PvP option.

Shouldn't there be five available monster and spell slots on the field 2. A max deck is 40 cards not 30 3. If a field card is in play, couldn't it alter the stadium to make it more fun. 4.
