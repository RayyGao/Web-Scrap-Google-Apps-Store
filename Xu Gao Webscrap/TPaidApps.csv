492,Productivity,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Michael Johnstone,Swype Keyboard,Top Paid in Android Apps,This *WAS* the best keyboard app ever. One of the highlights was being able to access secondary characters on the keyboard by pressing on the key. In the latest 'upgrade' that still works but the keyboard does not show the secondary characters! (They are still depicted when searching through themes but do not work when downloaded.)  When that is fixed I will give it a 5 star rating again.,"2,8,2017","Nuance Communications, Inc",3,391,665,0,0.4389,0.0,0,0.043

I've tried them all but this one is especially great for its gestures features to easily select text, copy, paste, capitalize words, etc. It is also great because the dictionary allows you to swipe out long things like email addresses, phone numbers, times...

Better than Google or Samsung keyboards purely because of ease of punctuation and double letter handling. The option for two languages at the same time is unmatched especially if you're bilingual or learning a language or like messaging multi lingual people.

I've been using Swype since my Galaxy S Fascinate. I've tried alternates, but kept coming back. There's something fundamentally right about the way Swype works. And try to force a number of layout in the others! (Ugh) For a few years, I needed Xposed, though. Slowly, we got theme support, then decent emoji implementation, and now a number row!  I would love it if Swype would look at the Xposed modules to implement those features. Those are the things people do when they have the power to change your software. Biggest wish for me: complete control over alternates visibility. I don't want to pick from just the themes where you've added alternates. Let me pick any theme, then adjust the visibility and subtlety of the alternates separately. I'd also love to change text colour.

I have sent the developer emails requesting a refund on the duplicated item but I have heard absolutely nothing.. nothing at all back from the developer.

I play every weekend and have a few albums on the market.   This is a great app.  You have to check some of the songs.

2269,News & Magazines,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Owen Marshall,Pocket Casts,Top Paid in Android Apps,"I adore this app. It makes it so easy to play and organize my podcasts. The auto download & auto add features are wonderfully useful, as well as the setting of only downloading while I am connected to Wi-Fi. Now I can not only get each new episode of my favorite podcast as soon as they are released, but can have them put automatically at the front or back of the queue as appropriate.   The interface is very well done and easy to use. And the dark color scheme is great for night time viewing.  I also love the ability to create playlists and filters. And I often use the Chromecast functionality at home.  My only current complaints are that I wish there was a way to rate &/or review podcasts, both to share them and to help with suggestions (a la Stitcher & iTunes). Also, the ability to fine tune priority of podcast episode autoplacement would be nice.   For example, suppose that podcasts A & B are my favorites with A being my preference over B. Then say that I have them set up to autodownload and to be put at the front of the Up Next queue. That is fine. But suppose that B downloads before I have a chance to listen to A? B will jump to the front ahead of A.","1,19,2017",Shifty Jelly,5,1172,645,0,0.9952,0.014,0,0.255
