30,Finance,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Christy Ward,IRS2Go,Top Free in Android Apps,"For those of you that have the message, incorrect information, you have to put the correct total in for the amount. So if you filed using a tax preparer such as H & R Block and they tell you your total federal return is 2576 but after fees your actual return is 2500, you have to enter in the app your 1st number return not the amount that you are expecting which is 2576.

They send the full amount aka the larger number because that's the amount they are going to pay, and the tax preparer take their cut.

However, after hearing from someone that SoundCloud had been having serious and drastic economic issues and researching this myself, I have reversed my initial opinion and will continue to support and make SoundCloud my go to place for my countless hours of listening.

Adds every 2 songs, distortion when played from Nougat devices and bugs that stop you from changing where you are in a track.  How can you have such a big platform and market share and constantly get it so wrong... Why not music related adds and a fair use add policy where it will only play an add after 4 full tracks have been played?  You have the monopoly with sound sharing apps... Why not channel money into making it stable with basic functionality that doesn't make people want to uninstall it.  I've loved SoundCloud for years but the way you QA testers have ruined this app and the desktop version of your site, with poor marketing and the direction of your company has started to turn your user base against you...

Videos fail to load, gifs fail to load, adding contacts sometimes fails. At best facebook messenger is inconsistent. And this is across multiple modern devices from different manufacturers. With so many other options out there for messaging, this one you can do without.  For positives, I can say this app has a lot of features, including sms integration, bots, and other third party integrations. However, while features are added and updates distributed, old problems persist.  This app is a constant source of frustration for me.","2,9,2017",Facebook,2,576,666,3,-0.9243,0.197,0,0.064

131,Finance,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Alpha Machina,IRS2Go,Top Free in Android Apps,"The app itself is fine, but this Path ACT is a massive issue for so many. The IRS is such a bureaucratic nightmare that they have to make people wait for months longer than usual for their refunds just to thwart fraud, when that should have been a fixture of the process to begin with. So why should it take longer? I know, because the people that work in these places are federal employees and ""it's good enough for gubment work"" goes a long way in places like that. And on top of that, the process will take even longer because the IRS doesn't work weekends or holidays.   Any company or corporation would work through down time to insure lesser problems don't crop up, but the drones at the IRS can't be bothered to do such a thing for the millions of people that are relying on that money simply to survive. If you're poor or you have a lot of children and filed with Earned Income Credit or Additional Child Credit you'll have to wait until the beginning of March before you see a dime of your money. The IRS will be scrutinizing every detail of every return of the less fortunate people in this country, when they should be looking the other direction, despite the fact that billions a year go to fraudulent tax claims and THAT is the issue I'm trying to address. The IRS should have been able to combat that in its entirety this entire time and have the proper manpower and procedures to get it done in the normal timeframe. But they're just now taking it seriously and instead of the IRS working harder, the poorest people in this country will be losing things like their homes, cars, electricity, gas or water, unable to pay for food and diapers. Because they rely on that money. The IRS is a joke.","1,26,2017",IRS,4,1707,652,15,-0.3174,0.091,0,0.093

You always get tackled within 10 yards of catching the ball if you're lucky no matter who you have as a return man. No chance of breaking one for a big gain.,"2,3,2017",ELECTRONIC ARTS,3,556,660,8,0.1442,0.085,0,0.082

It gives you the first ""chapter"" free, but the rest you have to unlock. How do you unlock chapters? By buying these keys. To unlock answer choices you need to buy ""diamonds"" to buy the answer choices. There is NO way you can earn ""diamonds"" unless you completely finish a story. If you do that you only get ONE diamond. You can't earn keys at all.

I would rather pay just once for a story and have all options included - just like in an actual ""Choose your own adventure"" book. Also, once we have opened a new chapter, we should be able to restart the chapter at no extra cost. Forwarding the story is too sensitive. Often I have accidentally touched the screen and was not able to read through and no way to go back, unless I spend another key. I suggest a ""next"" button instead.

Can't they do updates without penalizing the players or robbing them of their money spent which now becomes useless??","1,20,2017",Scopely,3,405,646,0,-0.3094,0.102,0,0.086

There are only 3 drawbacks, in my opinion. 1. Keys generate every 2 hours. I do wish they generated quicker since I play more than 1 book because of the great story lines. 2. While getting a diamond at the end of a chapter is nice, I wish it provided more than 1 so that more choices were made available. As it is, if you don't have enough diamonds then you are stuck with only one choice, which could be an issue to an ongoing story since the golden choices that require diamonds range from 15 to 25 needed.

I'll have a character who is hundreds of points above a opponent and I'll barely win. Sometimes I won't win! I hope to see more balanced matches or better use of the skills than hoping for a major match combo. Usually I'll make one weak match and the opponent will have a 10 match combo right after me. I absolutely love the game and it doesn't seem to be a cash grab like WWE Supercard. I used to love that game now it seems to be a system of if you're not paying you're not winning.  Anyway. I love the game and the little nods to WWE's past. Like Legend Killer Randy Orton or Ambrose in NXT having his original finisher by name. Definitely keep that going as I love to see what characters come next. I'd like to see women added too. And more current NXT people like Shinsuke.,"2,3,2017",Scopely,4,855,660,0,0.9905,0.063,0,0.265

You can spend hours on here!  Plus, it's great for saving space on your phone. I take pictures, post them, and then delete them from my cell phone.  Everything is easy! I believe you can create as many boards as you like. It's easy to save pics you like and post pics. You can also tell others users you like their pics just by clicking on a heart.

Still no fix for screen sharing. Spoke with Netflix shortly after the last update and they told me it was nothing on their end and that mirror casting is notoriously unreliable and that Netflix has nothing to do with mirror casting, it's a separate entity. I explained that I fully understand seeing as its a function of my Samsung S7 and not an option through the Netflix app and explained to THEM that, despite the fact that they don't have any hand in mirror casting, something in the update clashes with not only mine, but many users', ability to screen share and they need to look into it.  I hadn't had any issues with it before the update and it works fine since with any app/function that isn't Netflix.

And my controls were also switched. So forward button moved me backwards and vice versa. I wasn't able to come out of house and waited for my fuel to end.  Other issue: while jumping, sometimes it is difficult to see proper position of my player in air as there are other player's vehicle in between due to which I landed with crash couple of times.

The other thing that would be great, in my opinion, would be if they would change the frequency an artist's songs are played in the artist radio. For example, if I click the Rihanna station, it'd be nice if they played a Rihanna song first, then one or two related artist, back to Rihanna, another song or two from different artists, and so on.

The story doesn't have the most engaging plot, but it serves its purpose.

There is a fair amount of depth, but keep in mind that it's a freemium title meant to apeal to the casual gamer as well.
